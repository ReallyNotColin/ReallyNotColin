Guide to Git:

1. Download Git
2. Open the desired folder that will be a link to a repository on github
3. Rightclick, "Open GitBash" 
4. type git init
5. type git remote add origin PASTE HYPERLINK OF REPOSITORY HERE
6. type git pull origin main (pull from main branch), which pulls the repository to the folder 
7. create files, delete files; whatever you want. 
8. type git add .    (The period adds all files within folder)
9. type git commit -m "TYPE YOUR OWN MESSAGE HERE MAKE IT SHORT AND CONCISE"
10. git push origin main

Other Notes:
- I am sure there is some priority conflict with main and master branches but with just one person, it is fine
- Use "ls" to list everything in the folder. It is bash, so bash commands work (probably)
