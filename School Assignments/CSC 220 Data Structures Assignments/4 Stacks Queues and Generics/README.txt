Description: Program 4: Uses the Linked List and Node classes from Program 3 
 to create a small maze game with the goal of reaching the * through preset 
 controls that use generic Queue and Stack classes to move around. First, we
 had to create the Queue and Stack classes, then make them accept generic
 data types.
