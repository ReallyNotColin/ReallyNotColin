To play this game on a laptop/PC: 
- Execute Final.py
- Left Control is to fire projectile
- Use arrow keys to move
- Health is displayed as text in terminal

This is a project I made my Freshman year at Louisiana Tech for my CSC 132 Living With Cyber Course.
I'd love to revisit this in the future by adding more quality features such as a brief tutorial for
controls,and a HUD for how many lives the player has. Additionally, upon completing my Operating 
Systems class, I could add concorrent processes in the game instead of calling each function one at a 
time, or in consecutive lines.
