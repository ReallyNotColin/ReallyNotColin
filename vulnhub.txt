Guide to Vulnhub

1. Download Virtual Box
2. Download an "attacker" virtual machine (either kali or parrot, I used kali).
	2.5. sudo apt update to update the machine and thus get access to newer tools
	       sudo apt install TOOLNAME to get a specific tool (like exif for steganography)
3. Download a "target" virtual machine
4. Add both machines (ova or vbox files) to the virtual box
5. For each machine, click the "Settings" tab and go to the "Network" tab.
    Now on first "Adapter" tab, change "Attached to:" to "Internal Network." 
    Create a custom name for the internal network. Something like test-network or something like that
6. Go to your Host machine terminal (the computer you downloaded virtual box on == host machine) 
    change the directory to the virtual box files. Usually found C:/ Program Files / Oracle / Virtual Box
    copy the address as text and paste it into the terminal after "cd " to change directory
    Now paste this command into the terminal, but where it says "test-network2" you can sub in your own dhcp server name 
    vboxmanage dhcpserver add --netname test-network2 --ip 10.10.10.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0 --lowerip 10.10.10.2 --upperip 10.10.10.12 --enable
7. If no error appears, you downloaded it!! Type vboxmanage list dhcpservers to see your dhcp server running
