These are all the programming assignments I had to do in my Data Structures class, CSC 220, at Louisiana Tech University.
The class covered different data structures and abstract data types in Java. 
The topics learned are listed as, but not limited to: Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Trees, Heaps, Graphs,
  Hash Tables, Dictionaries, Multi-Dimensional Arrays, Time and Space complexity (Big O Notation), Prefix, Infix, Postfix,
  and a multitude of Sorting Algorithms.
