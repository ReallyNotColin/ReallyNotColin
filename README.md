- Hello! My name is Colin Bumpass or @ReallyNotColin. I am a junior studying Computer Science at Louisiana Tech University üê∂.
- I have studied Python, Java, C, C++, and Bash. In this repository you will find projects and assignments that I have worked on since pursuing my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree at Louisiana Tech back in September 2020.
- In September, I will be taking cyber security courses such as Networking Technical Essentials for Cyber Security and Applied Computer Networking. Until then, I am independently learning the basics of networking as well as how to acquire cyber security certifications with wesbites like pentesteracademy.com, hackthebox.eu, and ine.com!

- I am looking to collaborate on anything and everything! I am always ready to learn new things and meet new people!
