Description: Program 2: Creates and uses the People Class, which uses 
 the Person Class from the previous program to create an array of 5 
 Person objects and goes through each object at indecies 0-4 to find 
 the desired name and age in the Main Class, and returns nothing if 
 the array's index is >= 5.
 "The Good Place is the best show ever" was the hidden message the 
 "mystery" class provided, and I input it in the header to receive
 bonus points
